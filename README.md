# IdentityServer4.WsFederation
Full .Net Core implementation of WsFederation for IdentityServer4 and asp.net core. 

I built this because:
* Everything else i saw was targeted at .Net Framework
* I wanted to be able to use WsFederation while targeting .net core.
* I want it to be possible to deploy linux containers with a WsFederation Identity Provider.

## Getting Started
If you want to get started, see the Samples folders for a working server and client. Long-term, the easiest way to get started will be to clone the IdentityServer4.Quickstart project of your choice and then to add a nuget with a reference to the IdentityServer4.WsFederation plugin.

For now, it's probably easiest to just clone my this repo and either:
1. Modify the Sample server project to fit your needs
2. Create a new project, clone an IdentityServer4.Quickstart project, use the Startup.cs file in the Sample Server project.

### The code
Do the following in `Startup.cs` to use this plugin with Asp.net Core.
If you don't use MVC, obviously take that out.
```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc();
    // If you don't manually specify the digest and signature algorithms, it'll fail.
    var certificate = new X509Certificate2("IdentityServer4.WsFederation.Testing.pfx", "pw");
    var signingCredentials = new SigningCredentials(new X509SecurityKey(certificate), SecurityAlgorithms.RsaSha256Signature, SecurityAlgorithms.Sha256Digest);

    var builder = services.AddIdentityServer(options => 
    {
        options.IssuerUri = "urn:idsrv4:wsfed:server:sample";
    })
    .AddSigningCredential(signingCredentials) // Must use this overload.
    .AddTestUsers(TestUsers.Users)
    .AddInMemoryClients(Clients.TestClients)
    .AddInMemoryApiResources(new List<ApiResource>())
    .AddWsFederation();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    //OtherStuff
    app.UseIdentityServer();
    // app.UseMvc.....
}
```


## Supported Functionality
Right now, this is basically in the POC state and is my first pass at getting a working IdentityServer4 plugin to support WsFederation for passive authentication.

### Supported Workflows
* Signin
* Metadata

### Supported Parameters
* wa
* wreply
* wctx

### Supported Outputs
* wa
* wresult
* wctx

## Something Vaguely Resembling a Roadmap
I plan to do this stuff. I'll probably remember other things I want to do too.

### Top Priority Things
These are the things that I'm planning on doing pretty soon.
* I'm fairly certain I am doing Bad Stuff&trade; with the way I did some of the IdentityServer4-specific things.
* Need to double check the way I did the asp.net core extensions. 
* Need to make cookies configurable.
* Need to at least make an effort to organize the files.
* Need to figure out how I want to handle the awkwardness with the SigningCredentials. Short run, I can probably get a better solution. Long run, I think IdentityServer4 should probably make some small changes to their extensions. Need to understand better before I file an issue and potentially offer to "fix" it.

### Other things that are on the roadmap
These things are pretty much goals for the mid-term.
* Supporting the basic signout workflow.
* Supporting the rest of the easy parameters.
* Better input validation.
* Nuget package.
* Logging.

### Long-term features
These will mostly correspond to the parts of WsFederation that were not mentioned above.
* Rst as an input parameter.
* Pointers to the incoming rst or outgoing rstr.
* Encryption?
* Different token types - SAML 1.1 vs SAML 2.0
